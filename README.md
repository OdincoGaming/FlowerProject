# FlowerProject
 A protoype web app inspired by a TED Talk about the cities of the future; filled with plants.

 The idea is to encourage people to have more house plants by allowing them to interact with them online in a fun interactive setting,
and then making it so easy for them to commit to the purchase of a new plant they dont even have to open up a new tab!

Currently I have not reached out to any plant suppliers to see if they want the free advertising; so the one active plant kiosk goes to a youtube video that is an excerpt of some dialogue from Dark Souls 3.


Future plans:
===============================================
More plants

More furniture

Plant interactions with other plants/things in the environment

More secrets

Plant kiosks in the facility will lead directly to a website that 1) sells the plant associated with that kiosk and 2) the company owning that website actively uses funds to help with the Climate Crisis

Any artist that donates their plant models to the app will be given a billboard in the facility that is a live feed and link to their personalized url (or whatever the artist chooses to show on their billboard; within reason [no profanity or vulgar imagery of any kind; this is a wholesome product]).

An extra secret for anyone who completes the 4 main secrets in one play session.
